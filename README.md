## Summary
  
**Lacertocyon plumocrista** (*feather crested lizard dog*), also known as *feather maned dragon* or simply *maned dragon*.  
Although the name suggest similarities to reptiles and canines, L. plumocrista belongs to the distinct family Lacertheridae.  
The [crown group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_group) Lacertheriformes diverged from [Eutherians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutheria "Early placental mammals") and evolved parallel with modern [mammalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal) and [carnivora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivora).  
These resembling traits are a result of [convergent evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_evolution).  
  
**Temporal range:** [Pliocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliocene) to present

## Appearance  
Maned dragon's similarities to other modern species are largely coincidental due to the same environmental pressures that they faced.  
### Fur coat
- Maned dragons are covered in thin fur, and they have a feathered mane that reaches from their head down to the tip of the tail. The mane consists of feather-like [keratinous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratin "Similar composition as the fur") strands, that evolved from fur.  
- Their mane can puff up to appear bigger when threatened and acts as a protection and in heat regulation on cold nights.  
- Their color is a mix of yellows, browns, and greens with lighter [countershading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countershading "Lighter underside blends in with shadows for improved camoflauge"). The colorization varies regionally, mostly due to selective breeding and migrating individuals finding success in certain foliage. Seasonal changes can also have an impact on the coat thickness and color.  
- Their whiskers are as wide as their body front profile. When traversing narrow pathways, these whiskers will indicate when a gap is too narrow to fit.  
- Maned dragons have long ears to keep their body cool. The tufts at the ear tips help communicate with [conspecifics](# "Members of the same species") and feel what's above their head, similar to whiskers.
### Physiology
- Maned dragons have long [digitigrade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digitigrade "Stands on toes unlike plantigrades") legs to be able to see in tall foliage, making their gait akin to maned wolves.  
- They have five 3-segmented fingers and four 2-segmented toes, which are closer to reptilian hands than canine paws by appearance. While they are decent at swimming and capable of climbing, their legs and feet are specialized in tall foliage and grabbing onto prey.  
- Their skull streamlined similar to reptiles, with [external nares](# "External nostrils on top of the snout") positioned like crocodiles. They lack a [rhinarium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rhinarium "External wet nose like dogs or cats"), but smell receptors are still in the nasal cavity. The nasal cavity is wet to help with sensing scents.  
- The [dental formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentition#Dental_formula) of maned dragons (Upper: 3.1.4.3 / Lower: 3.1.4.3) is similar that of [Creodonta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creodonta). Their Incisors and prominent canines are similar to those of modern canids. The first two premolars have shallow cusp, becoming steeper with the third premolar, while the fourth premolar functions similarly to a carnassial tooth. The molars are robust and capable of breaking up bones, with distinctive cusps except the last upper molar, which is rounder.
  
## Behavior  
Maned dragons are [diurnal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diurnality "Active during daytime"). They have [trichromatic color vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichromacy "Can distinguish red, green and blue colors"), which is more advantageous in foraging, but this comes at the cost of poorer night vision.  
### Diet
- As solitary hunters they can hunt animals up to 60 kg, but their preferred prey is 20-40 kg.  
- Maned dragons rely on [ambush tactics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambush_predator) and endurance to outlast prey, as they are neither the fastest nor strongest predators.  
- Maned dragons are omnivorous and often forage and eat various vegetable matter.  
- When food is scarce, they can resort to scavenging. Their stomach acid is strong enough to partially digest bones.  
- Any indigestible material, such as fur or large fragments, is regurgitated in compacted pellets. 
### Habitat
- Their habitat is [dry tropical forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_and_subtropical_dry_broadleaf_forests) and [semiarid desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-arid_climate), and they are most active around temperatures of 10-25 C.  
- While maned dragons may share overlapping territories, they are rarely aggressive against others unless food is scarce.   
- Maned dragons communicate via howls and barks or roars like [maned wolves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maned_wolf). If maned dragons are threatened, they can make hissing and growling sounds.  
  
## Reproductive organs  
- The genitals of maned dragons are similar to those of some aquatic mammals, such as [cetaceans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cetaceans "Dolphins, whales, etc."), with a few differences.  
- Unlike female cetaceans, which have a [mammary slit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin#Reproduction_and_sexuality "Contains mammary glands, urethral orifice, anus and reprodctive organs in female cetaceans"), the anus is positioned outside the [urogenital slit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urogenital_sinus "Contains only reproductive organs and urethral orifice"), near the root of the tail.  
- Both male's and female's sexual organs are internal and the underside is normally featureless.  
- In males, the penis and testes are internal, with the penis extending during mating.  
- They have six teats similar in arrangement to canines, which are hidden under the fur and only become prominent during lactation in nursing females.  
- Outside the sexual organs, maned dragons have very little [sexual dimorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism "No obvious differences between sexes").  
  
## Reproduction  
- The female gives live birth and nurses a litter of 2 to 6 pups with a [gestation period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation "Time between conception and birth") of 3-4 months. 
- Maned dragons don't have a particular mating season, as this depends more on food abundance. They give birth to litter every 2 years or when the previous offspring have become independent.  
- During this period, the male may share the territory and assist with raising the offspring by hunting and providing protection. They don't necessarily share the same living space until the late stage of the gestation period. 
- While maned dragons don't form packs, they form relations between individuals and are often monogamous as the investment raising offspring is significant.  
- Juveniles become independent at 1-2 years of age. Full sexual maturity is reached at the age of 3-4 years old.  
  
## Venom  
- Maned dragon has venom glands in the lower jaw and some of their bottom teeth have grooves to help injecting the toxin into the target. 
- Their venom is especially useful when the prey is too large to be quickly subdued by teeth and claws alone. In such cases, maned dragons may continue stalking the target until the venom takes full effect.  
- The venom may also be used in defense, as it induces intense pain to repel any attackers.  
  
The maned dragon evolved a unique venom composition with effects similar to these components, the actual composition is currently unknown:  
- Intense pain: [Bradykinin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradykinin), [Capsaicin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsaicin "Active component in chili peppers")  
- Muscle paralysis: [Dendrotoxin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrotoxin), [Fasciculin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasciculin), [Conotoxin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conotoxin)  
- Venom spread promoters: [Phospholipase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phospholipase), [Metalloprotein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloprotein)

### [Late Cretaceous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous) 100-66 mya  
**Genus: Palutherium (Marsh beast)**  
- Early Lacertheriformes diverged during the late Cretaceous period from the Eutheria clade.  
- Palutherium was a small semi-aquatic otter- or shrew-like species that had an mixed diet, consisting of insects and fruits.  
- Its venom development started early from modified salivary glands. Making them poisonous, if eaten by a predator.  
- Like many small mammals, the early ancestors of Lacertocyon were nocturnal to avoid competition with dinosaurs.  years of age. Full sexual maturity is reached at the age of 3-4 years old.  
### [K-Pg extinction event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_extinction_event) 66 mya  
- Due to the extinction event, the species couldn't have been more than 25 kg, likely much smaller.  
- Being semi-aquatic provided more shelter, and an omnivorous diet was beneficial, as many plant and marine life died.  
### [Early paleocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleocene) 66-50 mya  
**Genus Palusaurictis (Marsh-reptile otter)**  
- Many species diversified rapidly after the K-Pg extinction event.  
- The ancestral species of Lacertocyon grew in size to fill niches after the extension event.  
- As dinosaurs became extinct, the species shifted towards diurnal.  
- Other semi-aquatic features evolved further, such as webbed fingers, skull structure, and tail shape, to aid swimming in water.  
- As competing species grew in size, Palusaurictis' claws, teeth and venom became more sophisticated. Venom grooves formed in lower teeth.  
- This semi-aquatic ancestral species stalked prey in water similar to crocodiles.  
### [Eocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eocene) 50-34 mya  
- Proto-Lacertherids transitioned from a semi-aquatic lifestyle to a more terrestrial one, due to environmental pressures.  
- Specialization of digitigrade legs, bigger ears, and improved eyesight to better suited outside water.  
- As the species became fully diurnal, they developed better trichromatic color vision for foraging, though this came at the cost of poorer night vision.  
- Outside water, the fur doesn't need to be as dense, but the mane developed to appear bigger and puff up when threatened. The mane fur strands grew in width and length, which eventually started to resemble feathers.  
### Late Eocene 34 mya to 5.3 mya  
- Advanced Lacertherids became fully terrestrial and further adapted to semi-arid and dry tropical environments.  
- More competition from other carnivores results in adaptability of diet and behavior.  
- As the gestation period lengthened, taking care of offspring became more important.  
- Socializing with conspecifics may have become more beneficial to stay competitive with other predators and maintain territories.  
### [Pliocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliocene) 5.3 mya to present  
- Modern maned dragons emerged from the Lacertheridae lineage.

### List of remnant features of Lacertherids from their semi-aquatic ancestry:  
- Venomousness  
- Skull, tail shape  
- Finger arrangement  
- Somewhat dexterous hands and limbs  
- Genital slit  
- Rib cage flexibility and structure  
- Nostrils ability to close when submerged in water  
- [Nictitating membrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nictitating_membrane) in the eyes  
- Elongated toes and flattened bones in the hands and feet
