## Summary
- **[Lacertocyon plumocrista](https://github.com/Kaelygon/Lacertocyon-plumocrista)**: Fictional species *feather maned dragon*, belonging to the family Lacertheridae.
- **Lacertheridae**: Fictional extant family of *lizard beasts* to which the maned dragon belongs. This is the primary family within the order Lacertheriformes.
